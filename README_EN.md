# Personal website of Andreas Lezgus
Portfolio: https://www.lezgus.de

NOTE: This README is also available in <a href=https://github.com/AndreasLezgus/Website/blob/master/README.md>German</a>.

This document is intended for a technical audience and represents the latest state of architecture and code of my website, which may not yet be final. I'm always happy to hear about improvements and ideas on how to optimize the pages.


## About this project?
This documentation and the program code was created by myself and is used as my personal portfolio website. My old developer heart always tries to understand how something works. Trying, making mistakes, learning and desperately searching for the typo in the code. The blueprint and source code of these pages can be copied, checked, modified and improved by everyone.


## Who am I?
Andreas Lezgus, https://www.lezgus.de/story.html


## What is the goal of this project?
These portfolio pages are usually static and the frequency of changes is manageably low. The idea of the project was therefore to go back to the roots.
Simple static HTML and CSS. No scripting language. No database.
Publishing on low cost Amazon Web Services S3 storage with simple CI/CD tools for testing, versioning and publishing.
Use of a worldwide distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Updating the pages with a simple text editor platform independent from any device. Let's see how far I get with these simple tools?

Interactive content, such as my blog, is merely linked to the respective platform by references.
