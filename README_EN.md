# Personal website of Andreas Lezgus
Portfolio: https://www.lezgus.de

This document is intended for a technical audience and represents the latest state of architecture of my website, which may not yet be final. I'm always happy to hear about improvements and ideas on how to optimize the pages.

NOTE: This README is also available in <a href=https://github.com/AndreasLezgus/Website/blob/master/README.md>German</a>. Thank you for understanding that the German version might not always be up-to-date with the english one.

## About this project?
This documentation and the program code was created by myself and is used as my personal portfolio website. My old developer heart always tries to understand how something works. Trying, making mistakes, learning and desperately searching for the typo in the code. The blueprint and source code of these pages can be copied, checked, modified and improved by everyone.

## What is the goal of this project?
This website and the program code was created by myself. My old developer heart is always trying to understand how something works. Trying, making mistakes, learning and desperately searching for the typo in the code. The blueprint and source code of these pages can be copied, checked, modified and improved by everyone.

The idea of the project was to go back to the roots.
Simple static HTML and CSS. No scripting language. No database.
Publishing on inexpensiv Amazon Web Services S3 storage and simple CI/CD practices to test, versioning and publishing.
Use of a worldwide distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Easy updating with a simple text editor from any device.

Interactive content, such as my blog, is simply linked to the respective platform.
